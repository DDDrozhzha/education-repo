# Data analytics & Data visualization

Hi everyone :wave:

My name is **Darya Drozhzha** and I'm a **Data analyst** from Minsk, Belarus. You can find more info about me and my career path using my page in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryadrozhzha/).

To be honest, I created GitHub for several significant reasons. Firstly, I will be able to demonstrate my professional achievements. Secondly, it's a nice opportunity to share my own experience and adopt others' ones. Thirdly, I will be able to see my professional growth over the time, so as not to forget and depreciate my efforts. I think it's important.

Let's start our exciting journey into the world of analytics! :rocket::rocket::rocket:
